  NumVP is a simple educational and entertainment Flutter application for Android.
  It contains multiple modules such as games, instruments, songs, sounds and
  stories. The project demonstrates the use of the three_dart package to render
  simple 3D scenes and uses go_router and provider for navigation and state
  management.

  # Plugin to render interactive 3D models (glTF/GLB). This widget embeds Google's
  # <model-viewer> web component, enabling us to display 3D models and play
  # their animations directly in Flutter. It supports glTF/GLB formats, animated
  # models, auto‑rotation and AR modes【210132009004240†L174-L185】.
  model_viewer_plus: ^1.9.3

  # Audio playback for stories and interactive games. This package supports
  # playing local and remote audio files and is widely used in Flutter apps.
  # Upgrade audioplayers to a recent version that declares the Android namespace
  # See https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers for latest releases. Version 6.x
  # depends on audioplayers_android >=5.x which defines the required
  # `namespace` property in its build.gradle, avoiding AGP 8 errors.
  audioplayers: ^6.5.1

dependency_overrides:
  # Ensure the Android implementation is at least version 5.2.1, which
  # specifies a namespace. Without this override, a transitive older
  # audioplayers_android (e.g., 1.1.3) may be pulled in by other packages,
  # leading to build failures【279751166207276†L144-L162】.
  audioplayers_android: ^5.2.1

  # Animated text kit to display animated headings and labels. We'll use this
