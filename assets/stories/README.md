Place story image sequences in this directory.

Each story should have its own subfolder containing ordered image files
(e.g. `page1.png`, `page2.png`, ...). These images will be displayed in
sequence while the story narration plays. For example, you could have
`assets/stories/story1/page1.png`, `page2.png`, etc. The `StoryPlayerScreen`
will search for all `.png` files in the appropriate subfolder.
