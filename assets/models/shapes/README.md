Place 3D models for the shapes game here.

Required files:

- **title.glb** – Animated 3D title for the shapes game. This model is displayed at the top of the shapes screen.
- **cube.glb** – A 3D cube model.
- **sphere.glb** – A 3D sphere model.
- **cylinder.glb** – A 3D cylinder model.

You can create these models in your favourite 3D editor (e.g. Blender) and export them as GLB. Ensure that the files are added to this directory and declared in your pubspec.yaml under `assets/models/`.
