Place general 3D models for instruments here.

This folder contains subfolders for specific instruments (piano, drums, xylophone).
If you have any 3D models that represent the instruments menu itself or generic
instruments that don't belong to a particular instrument, put them directly in
this directory. For example, if you want to include a 3D model of a guitar
for a future game or display, you can store it here.
