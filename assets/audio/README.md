Place audio files for stories and games in this directory.

For example, you might have an audio narration for a story at
`assets/audio/story1.mp3`. The `StoryPlayerScreen` will attempt to load
corresponding audio based on the story identifier. You can organise files
into subfolders if you have multiple stories.
