Place icon and images for the **Vehicles** sound category here.

For example, you might include:

- `icon.png` – a small icon representing vehicles (cars, trains, planes, etc.) used in the menu.
- `car.png`, `train.png`, `plane.png`, etc., for individual sound illustrations.

These assets will be referenced in your Flutter code as:
`assets/images/sounds/vehicles/icon.png`.
