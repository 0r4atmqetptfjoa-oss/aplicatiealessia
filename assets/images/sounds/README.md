# Sounds Images

This directory contains subfolders for each sound category. For each category, place
a representative icon (e.g., `icon.png`) and any illustrative images that should
appear in the sound details screen. You can organize the images as follows:

- **vehicles/**: Images representing cars, trains, planes, etc.
- **farm/**: Images for farm animals and machinery.
- **jungle/**: Pictures of wild jungle animals.
- **maritime/**: Boats, ships and other maritime vehicles.
- **birds/**: Birds and other flying creatures.

Each subfolder includes a `README.md` with further guidance. If you add new
categories, create a new subfolder here and update `pubspec.yaml` and
`sounds_menu_screen.dart` accordingly.
